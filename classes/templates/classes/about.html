        <h4 class="pb-4">Why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?</h4>
        <p class="font-weight-light py-1">
            Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a martial art, combat sport system that focuses on grappling and especially ground
            fighting.
            BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger,
            heavier assailant by using proper technique,
            leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint-locks and choke holds to
            defeat the opponent.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-light py-1">
            BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments. However it can be used in some self-defence
            situations and does serve its purpose.
            Sparring (commonly referred to as rolling) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is
            placed on performance, especially in competition,
            in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.

        <h4 class="pb-4">Why Kickboxing?</h4>
        <p class="font-weight-light py-1">
            Kickboxing is a stand-up combat sport that is a mix of Karate, Muay Thai and Western Boxing.
            It combines powerful kicks from Karate and agile handwork from boxing and is practiced as for fitness, self-defence and also as a contact sport.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-light py-1">
            Kickboxing offers a great cardio workout, improved strength, an opportunity to socialise, core training, increased weight loss, improved balance and stress reduction.
            Because kickboxing uses every major muscle group in the body, the demand on the cardiovascular system is increased.
            As a result, 30 to 60 minutes of kickboxing three or more times per week may be all a member needs to improve cardiovascular fitness.

        <h4 class="pb-4">Why Boxing?</h4>
        <p class="font-weight-light py-1">
            Boxing is an intense aerobic and anaerobic workout that pushes the body to its physical limits.
            In just a few sessions, boxing can make you stronger, faster, sharper, and help you start the journey of getting in the best shape of your life.
            But boxing would never be effective as a workout if it weren’t so enjoyable and  engaging.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-light py-1">
            One of the biggest reasons why boxing is such an addictive martial art to train and practice is because it is an incredibly technical discipline.
            Picking it up is easy enough, but mastering it takes a lot of work and dedication. For this reason, practitioners are on a constant path of learning.
            Boxing is also one of the most potent self-defense disciplines to use in the real world.
