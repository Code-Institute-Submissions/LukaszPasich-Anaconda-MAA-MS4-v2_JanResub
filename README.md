Project still incomplete

1. I couldn't' deploy to heroku
    - there was an issue with my repository being a shallow clone,
    - i thought I solved it with <code>git fetch --unshallow</code>,
    - the code was puhed to heroku and app was built succesfully but when I tried to open the link there was an application error
    - <code>heroku logs --tail</code> shows errors H10 and H13, I dont know how to solve this

2. I Still need to write a full readme file
3. I need to connect emails from Contact page and setup email confirmations for orders
